        Hi, I'm Archie. I'm an 8 week old Golden Retriever Pup living in Old Town, Maine.
    My parents drove all the way to West Newfield, Maine to get me and take me home.
    So far, I like my new home and my new parents, we have lots of fun. I really like
    to take naps though. My parents don't mind because they get to snuggle me all the time.
    My favorite toy is my Zebra because he's soft and fun to chew on, and he has a rope tail.
    I've only had an "accident" on one person and it was my dad's cousin because he was
    wearing a New York Giants sweatshirt. My parents say I'm a really good boy even when I keep them up
    all night.
